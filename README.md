# distsysraft
For the course project of the Distributed systems course we propose a GoLang Implementation of the Raft Consensus Algorithm<br>
But there is a catch!<br>
Indeed.<br>
It was made using a SaathRaftAssistant!<br>
In this project we propose SaathRaftAssistant - a novel, state-of-the-art assistant that does all the work for you!<br>
No Consensus? that's hella sus!<br>
Because with the SaathRaftAssistant it is practically impossible to not achieve consensus at a distributed storage system<br>
SaathRaftAssistant does the following:<br>
- Elects leader effectively given past behavior of the nodes, i.e it learns the chances of a node failing!
- Performs Log replication across all nodes with state of the art SaathRoutines! It's a next-gen parallel execution framework that comes paired with SaathRaftAssistant
- Smoothly Handles all edgecases for unforseen circumstances! Yes, you heard me - SaathRaftAssistant takes care of this too
- Steals yo girl, wtf did you think? SaathRaftAssistant only stops here? heck no
- Steals yo job, lmao you heard it, now you're unemployed too! because SaathRaftAssistant can do your job too
- Travels back in time and hands your dad a condom - cause why not? SaathRaftAssistant focuses on saving resources, which you're already wasting

That's about it.
